# Lab Assigment 3.5: ROS2 Messages, Services and Actions
The purpose of this lab assignment is to learn how to customize messages, services and actions.

This is a set of tutorials while we wait for the Surface computers to be configured, and it's why it's half a lab.

## Task 1: Custom Messages and Services
The biggest advantage with ROS2 is that you can expand the message system. This makes it possible to customize your packages to send and receive information.

Go through the tutorial to create custom messages and services:

## Task 2: Actions
While messages are used to broadcast a stream of information, services are meant to request and receive information, actions are meant to make the robot perform a sequence of actions and provide feedback while it's doing to.
